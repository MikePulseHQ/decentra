# Admin Settings Location Guide

## Overview
The Admin Settings option is available in the Decentra application for the first user (admin) to configure server-wide settings.

## How to Access Admin Settings

### Step 1: Log in as the First User
Only the first user who signed up on the server has access to Admin Settings. This user is automatically designated as the administrator.

### Step 2: Open the User Menu
1. Look at the **bottom left** corner of the chat interface
2. Find your username displayed there
3. Click the **⚙ (gear/settings) button** next to your username

### Step 3: Select Admin Settings
In the menu that appears, you'll see the following options:
- Profile Settings
- Set Avatar
- Notification Settings
- Friends
- Create Server
- Join Server
- Generate Invite
- **Admin Settings** ← Click this option
- Logout

**Note:** The "Admin Settings" option is only visible if you are logged in as the first user (admin). Other users will not see this option in their menu.

The Admin Settings page allows you to configure:

### Server Information

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see "Admin Settings" in the menu
**Possible reasons:**
1. **You are not the first user**: Only the very first user who signed up on the server can access Admin Settings
2. **Check you're logged in as the right user**: Make sure you're logged in with the first user account created on this server

### How do I know if I'm the first user?
- The first user is the one who signed up when the server was first set up
- If you can see "Admin Settings" in your user menu, you are the admin
- If you don't see it, you are not the admin - contact the person who set up the server

## Security Note
Admin privileges cannot be transferred or shared. The first user remains the only administrator. This is by design to maintain server security and prevent unauthorized configuration changes.
